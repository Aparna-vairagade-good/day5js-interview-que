  <div> <p> 1. What is hoisting?</p>
    <p> JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes 
     to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code. Hoisting is not a term normatively defined in the ECMAScript specification.
     Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior in which a function or a variable can be used before declaration.</p>
 </div>

   <div><p> 2. What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</p>
    <p> Temporal Dead Zone is the period of time during which the let and const declarations cannot be accessed. 
     Temporal Dead Zone starts when the code execution enters the block which contains the let or const 
     declaration and continues until the declaration has executed.</p>
 </div>
 <div> <p>  3.What is the DOM?</p>
  <p>  The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure 
    and content of a document on the web.</p>
<pre>const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p");
    alert(paragraphs[0].nodeName);
</pre>
</div>
    
<div><p>4.Explain passed by value and passed by reference</p>
  <p>In pass-by value in JavaScript, a copy of the original variable is created, so any changes made to the copied 
    variable do not affect the original variable. In pass-by reference in JavaScript, we pass the reference of the 
    actual parameter. No copy is created in the memory.</p>
  <pre>let a=5
      let b=a;
      console.log(a)
      console.log(b)
      b=6
      console.log(a)
      console.log(b)
  
      output:5
             5
             5
             6
  </pre>
  <pre>let obj2=obj
      console.log(obj)
      console.log(obj2)
      obj2.name="ashwini"
      console.log(obj)
      console.log(obj2)
  
      output:
      name:shivani
      name:shivani 
      name:ashwini 
      name:ashwini
  </pre>
</div>

<div><p>5. Write code to explain map and filter in arrays</p>
  <pre>const numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4];
      const newArr = numbers.map(myFunction);
      
      console.log(newArr)
      
      function myFunction(num) {
        return num * 10;
      }
      output:[650,440,120,40]
  </pre>
  <pre>const ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];
      console.log(ages.filter(checkAdult))
      
      function checkAdult(age) {
        return age >= 18;
      }
  
      output:[32,33,40]
  </pre>
  </div>
<div><p>6. What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</p>
  <p>The async keyword turns a method into an async method, which allows you to use the await keyword in its body. 
    When the await keyword is applied, it suspends the calling method and yields control back to its caller until 
    the awaited task is complete. await can only be used inside an async method.</p>
  </div>
<div><p>7. Give an example of async/await</p>
  <pre>async function f() {
  
      let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)
      });
      let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)
      alert(result); // "done!"
    }
    f();
  
    output:giving alert massage "done!"
  </pre>
</div>
